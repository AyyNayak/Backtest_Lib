**Strategy Ideas**
_Purely Price Momentum_
```
1. EMA + RSI scalping with RR, needs analysis
2. Moving window logic (with proper testing on LTF, variable RR, variable window size) : https://riunet.upv.es/bitstream/handle/10251/78837/MICHNIUK%20-%20PATTERN%20RECOGNITION%20APPLIED%20TO%20CHART%20ANALYSIS.%20EVIDENCE%20FROM%20INTRADAY%20INTERNATIONAL%20ST....pdf?sequence=1
3. Other TA-lib based strats
```
_Price and Volume_
```
1. VPSV based mean reversion, needs analysis (this is with correlation of large orders at or around VPSV of a session)
```
